# 🏠 Home Automation System (Java Case Study)

## 📌 Project Overview
The Home Automation System is a Java-based application designed to automate and manage household appliances and electrical devices across multiple rooms. This system allows users to remotely control devices, monitor their status, and manage gadgets efficiently using an object-oriented approach.

This project demonstrates core Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts by simulating a real-world smart home environment.
